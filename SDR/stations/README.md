# Software defined radio

This repository contains code for reading data into Python from an RTL-SDR dongle, developed by undergraduate intern Ryan Gao. FMstations.py contains a list of FM stations in the San Francisco Bay Area that are used by sdr_stations.ipynb for reading in data from a dongle, and identifying and plotting the peaks corresponding to the stations.
