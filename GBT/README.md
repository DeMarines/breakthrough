GBT file formats are highly technical. We start with raw voltages from the telescope, and store files in so-called baseband format. Some applications work directly with these baseband files, but we can also take the baseband files and produce filterbank files, which have a short header and the rest of the spectral data stored as a binary blob.

The data in the Breakthrough Listen archive are a mix of baseband and filterbank. You might want to start by looking at some filterbank files, for example our sample data on the Voyager spacecraft. If you've explored the filterbank formats and want to wade deeper, you might try digging around with some of the baseband files.
