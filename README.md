# UC Berkeley Breakthrough Listen software and tutorials

We're starting to put together a repository of software and tutorials for interacting with Breakthrough Listen data. This repository will grow with time but for now you can explore some sample Automated Planet Finder and Green Bank Telescope datasets, including a guided tutorial in detecting the Voyager spacecraft in GBT data, a task which helps us make sure our instruments are performing as expected. You can use some of the tools here to interact with data in the Breakthrough Listen public archive, or begin to develop your own software.

The science team at UC Berkeley is particularly interested in discussions with experts in machine learning and big data techniques, and in those with computer science and scientific expertise who want to help us to further develop our tools to distinguish between terrestrial sources of interference, and potential extraterrestrial signals. We're also working on curriculum, with a focus on undergraduate researchers, to train the next generation of scientists who will participate in the search.
